## About

In our day-to-day lives, we see many people struggling to get employment because they do not meet the specific requirements set by companies. To reduce and erase this misconception about skills, our team is building a website known as Knicnac-1. Our main goal is to provide employment based on the skills people have, rather than what skills companies want.
